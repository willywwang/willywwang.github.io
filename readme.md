KNOWN ISSUES:
- Contact form inconsistent 
- Various pieces of website look weird on non-native resolutions (extremely downscaled/zoomed-out on devices with small screens)
- The website is slow. Known issue working on compressing files and speeding up overall performance of site
- Various typos (send me whatever typos you see, might be working on them as we speak!)

THINGS TO DO:
- Make this website better on mobile devices. It works right now, but experience could be MUCH better. 
- IN-LINE STYLING MUST GO. I don't know why I even have in-line styling, but must refactor it ALL out.
- Fix any inconsistent font/css issues
