Website now deprecated. Please visit www.will-wang.ca for newest prototype.

CURRENT VERSION: 1.1.01

VERSION HISTORY:
  VERSION: 1.1.01:
  - Quality of life changes to Mobile Menu now let you click anywhere in the bar to click
  - Mobile menu is now responsive and will not be consistent on all resolutions
  - Using third party software for contact form due to Git Pages not supporting PHP (static pages :\) 
  VERSION: 1.1.00:
  - Updating client side calls to better improve user experience
  - Design modernized 
  - Website modified to be responsive on most major resolutions (IPad, IPhone 5, 6, 6+, Desktop, etc.)

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Various pieces of website look weird on non-native resolutions (extremely downscaled/zoomed-out on devices with small screens)
- The website is slow. Known issue working on compressing/caching files and speeding up overall performance of site
- Various typos (send me whatever typos you see, might be working on them as we speak!)

THINGS TO DO:
- Make this website better on mobile devices. It works right now, but experience could be MUCH better. 
- IN-LINE STYLING MUST GO. I don't know why I even have in-line styling, but will refactor it out.
- Fix any inconsistent font/css issues
